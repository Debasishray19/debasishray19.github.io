<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p>The 2.5D acoustic wave solver is an expanded two-dimensional model that effectively approximates wave propagation in tube-like geometries through the finite-difference numerical scheme. It seamlessly combines the computational efficiency characteristic of low-dimensional models with the precision associated with three-dimensional methods. Unlike one- and two-dimensional models, which are confined to radial symmetry, our lightweight 2.5D solver adeptly accommodates irregular geometries, guided solely by mid-sagittal symmetry.</p>
<p>Below, we showcase the geometries of three virtual bores and present the corresponding audio samples synthesized using the 2.5D solver. The audio samples have a consistent pitch (approximately 261Hz) but different timbral signatures.</p>
