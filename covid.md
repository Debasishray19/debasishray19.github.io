Starting today (March 16, 2020), I will be socially distancing myself, as per recommendation from the Johns Hopkins administration. I will now be working from home until further notice. You can reach me at all times except when I am sleeping (usually 11 PM to 7 AM) on all days (Monday to Sunday) using any of the following:

* Phone: (443) 824-3377
* Whatsapp: (443) 824-3377
* [Facebook Messenger](https://www.facebook.com/r.desh26)
* Gmail/Hangout: r.desh26@gmail.com
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rdesh26)

I have notifications turned on for all these modes, and will usually respond in < 5 minutes, unless I am cooking/eating.

Stay safe, and keep in (virtual) touch!
