<br>I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a>, advised by <a
	href="https://www.ece.ubc.ca/faculty/sid-fels">Sidney Fels</a> and <a
	href="https://toomuchidle.com/">Victor Zappi</a>. Currently, I am affiliated with <a href="http://hct.ece.ubc.ca/">HCT Lab</a>. My research interests lie in 
	articulatory speech synthesis and neural control of speech synthesizer for speech production task. I am currently modelling a physics-based <b>human vocal tract</b> that
        could help in designing <b>real-time articulatory speech synthesizers</b>. To know more about my research, check out my <a href="https://debasishray19.github.io/publications/">publications</a>.<br><br>


I graduated from UBC Vancouver in 2021 with a major in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My <a href="https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0396919">master thesis</a> was on introducing a novel computational vocal 
tract model that improves the exising low-dimensional models, supervised by <a href="https://www.ece.ubc.ca/faculty/sid-fels">Sidney Fels</a>.<br><br>

Outside of research, I love <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/45967561">running</a> and <a href="https://www.debasishraymohapatra.com/">photography</a>.
Occasionally, I write in <a href="https://debasishray19.github.io/mywriting/">Odia</a>. <br>
