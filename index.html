<br>I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/"> The University of British Columbia</a>, advised by <a
	href="https://www.ece.ubc.ca/faculty/sid-fels">Sidney Fels</a> and <a
	href="https://toomuchidle.com/">Victor Zappi</a>. And, I am affiliated with <a href="http://hct.ece.ubc.ca/">HCT Lab</a>. My research interests lie in 
	articulatory speech synthesis and neural control of speech synthesizer for speech production task. Currently, I am modelling a physics-based <b>human vocal tract</b> that
        could help in designing <b>real-time articulatory speech synthesizer</b> and understanding the speech production mechanism. To know more about my research, check out my <a href="https://debasishray19.github.io/publications/">publications</a>.<br><br>


I obtained a Bachelor in Electronics & Communication Engineering (ECE) at <a href="https://www.soa.ac.in/iter">ITER, Bhubaneswar</a> (India); MASc (Master in applied science) in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">UBC, Vancouver</a> (Canada). My <a href="https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0396919">master thesis</a> introduces a novel computational vocal 
tract model that improves the exising low-dimensional models (supervised by <a href="https://www.ece.ubc.ca/faculty/sid-fels">Sidney Fels</a>).<br><br>

Outside of research, I love <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/45967561">running</a> and <a href="https://www.debasishraymohapatra.com/">photography</a>.
Occasionally, I write in <a href="https://debasishray19.github.io/mywriting/">Odia</a>. <br>
