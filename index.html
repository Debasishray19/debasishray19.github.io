<br>I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">The University of British Columbia</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.ece.ubc.ca/faculty/sid-fels">Prof. Sidney Fels</a> and <a href="https://toomuchidle.com/">Prof. Victor Zappi</a>. I am currently affiliated with the <a href="http://hct.ece.ubc.ca/">HCT Lab</a>.
My Ph.D. research focuses on developing a physics-based <b>two-dimensional (2D) vocal tract model</b> that is computationally lightweight and offers greater geometrical flexibility compared to conventional 2D models. This model aims to support the design of <b>real-time articulatory speech synthesizers</b> and advance our understanding of human speech production mechanisms.
My research interests include speech technology, brain-computer interfaces, and human-computer interactions.

I obtained a Bachelor in Electronics & Communication Engineering (ECE) at <a href="https://www.soa.ac.in/iter">Siksha 'O' Anusandhan University, Bhubaneswar</a> (India); M.A.Sc. (Master in applied science) in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">UBC, Vancouver</a> (Canada). My <a href="https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0396919">master thesis</a> (supervised by <a href="https://www.ece.ubc.ca/faculty/sid-fels">Sidney Fels</a>) introduces a novel computational vocal 
tract model that improves the exising low-dimensional (2D) model.<br><br>

Outside of research, I love <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/45967561">running</a> and photography.
Occasionally, I write in <a href="https://debasishray19.github.io/mywriting/">Odia</a>. <br>
