<h1>Talking Tube</h1>
  
<p>Talking Tube is a physics-based lumped two-dimensional (2D) vocal tract model 
having acoustic characteristics comparable to a precise three-dimensional (3D) vocal tract model. 
It improves the existing 2D vocal tracts to provide better geometrical flexibility at a lower computational overhead.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Speech production is a complex but unique physiological process which requires the neuromuscular and biomechanical control of the
human vocal apparatus (e.g., lips, jaw, tongue, etc.). A possible way of exploring some of these underlying speech production mechanisms 
is to build an articulatory-acoustic model, i.e., a quantitative computer-implemented emulation of the human speech organs 
that can generate acoustic speech signals (Kroger, 2022).</p>
