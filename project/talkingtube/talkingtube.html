<h1>Talking Tube</h1>
  
<p>Talking Tube is a physics-based lumped two-dimensional (2D) vocal tract model 
having acoustic characteristics comparable to a precise three-dimensional (3D) vocal tract model. 
It improves the existing 2D vocal tracts to provide better geometrical flexibility at a lower computational overhead.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Speech production is a complex but unique physiological process which requires the neuromuscular and biomechanical control of the
human vocal apparatus (e.g., lips, jaw, tongue, etc.). A possible path to explore these underlying speech production mechanisms is to 
build an articulatory-acoustic model (i.e., a quantitative computer-implemented emulation of the human speech organs or biomechanical 
articulatory speech synthesizer - BASS) that can generate acoustic speech signals (Kroger, 2022). Designing such an articulatory-acoustic 
model as a single unit is highly complex. Hence, it can be modularized into three primary components based on their core functionality.</p><br>

<p>(1) A biomechanical model that generates articulatory kinematic movements from muscle activations and incorporates speech-related constraints.<br>
(2) A vocal fold model that emulates the movement of vocal cords in the larynx and generates glottal flow as the acoustic source.<br>
(3) A vocal tract model that synthesizes acoustic speech signals for a specified vocal tract geometry (i.e., the shape of the upper oral cavity).<br><br>
  
This project primarily focuses on vocal tract acoustic modelling.</p>
