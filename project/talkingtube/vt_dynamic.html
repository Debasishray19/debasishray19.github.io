<h1>Diphthong Synthesis</h1>

<p>
Diphthong production entails a swift transition of the vocal tract configuration from one vowel posture to another 
within a short time frame. Accurately modeling these dynamic articulatory movements is crucial for natural-sounding 
speech synthesis and for the clinical assessment of voice quality. Numerous vocal tract acoustic models have been 
proposed in the literature; however, most focus on static tract geometries for producing isolated vowel sounds.
Only recently have efforts been made to address dynamic articulatory configurations. In this work, we introduce a 
two-dimensional (2D) dynamic vocal tract model that employs the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) to synthesize diphthongs.
